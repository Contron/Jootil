Jootil
=====
A comprehensive Java library to provide additional useful plumbing for a JavaFX application, allowing you to focus on actually developing it.

Jootil requires no messy XML or pre-set configuration. It's designed to simply provide the abilities that any application would want alongside it.

Features
-----
- Settings manager to load and save application settings in XML files
- Objects manager to load and save persistent objects between sessions, also in XML files
- A range of pre-built dialog boxes to use and extend (such as message and input dialogs)
- A range of pre-built controls to compliment these dialogs (such as a status bar)
- Localisation features to allow bilingual application development
- Utility classes to facilitate with common tasks (such as formatting a file's size to something human-readable)
- Style classes to facilitate with building styles for nodes
